# ZKLoan Credit Scorer — Contract Reference

Reference for the Compact contract. Reflects `pragma language_version >= 0.22 && <= 0.23` and the Midnight toolchain 0.31.0 / ledger v8 build. **Caller identity is witness-derived throughout — `ownPublicKey()` is not called by this contract.** The admin role and per-user identity both derive from a single 32-byte `userSecretKey` in private state via domain-separated hashes.

## Project Overview

Privacy-preserving loan DApp on Midnight. Demonstrates:

1. Processing sensitive financial data (credit score, income, tenure) privately via ZK proofs
2. Verifying off-chain attestations with an in-circuit Schnorr signature on Jubjub before trusting the credit profile
3. Storing only non-sensitive outcomes (loan status, approved amount) on the public ledger
4. Managing a nested map of user loans on-chain
5. Batched migration of a user's loans when they rotate their PIN

## Compact Contract Details

### File: `contract/src/zkloan-credit-scorer.compact`

**Language version**: `pragma language_version >= 0.22 && <= 0.23`

### Types

```compact
export enum LoanStatus {
    Approved,      // Approved outright, or accepted after a Proposed offer
    Rejected,      // Applicant did not meet minimum tier eligibility
    Proposed,      // Requested amount exceeded the user's eligible tier — awaiting user decision
    NotAccepted,   // User declined a Proposed offer
}

export struct LoanApplication {
    authorizedAmount: Uint<16>;
    status: LoanStatus;
}

struct Applicant {  // private, not exported
    creditScore: Uint<16>;
    monthlyIncome: Uint<16>;
    monthsAsCustomer: Uint<16>;
}

// From schnorr.compact, re-exported
export struct SchnorrSignature {
    announcement: JubjubPoint;
    response: Field;
}
```

### Ledger State

| Variable | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `blacklist` | `Set<UserPublicKey>` | Blocked derived user public keys (not wallet addresses) |
| `loans` | `Map<Bytes<32>, Map<Uint<16>, LoanApplication>>` | User pubkey → loanId → loan |
| `onGoingPinMigration` | `Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<16>>` | Tracks last migrated loanId per in-progress PIN change |
| `contractAdmin` | `AdminPublicKey` | Derived public key of the current admin. The matching secret lives in private state; the admin proves possession inside the ZK circuit. Rotatable via `rotateAdmin`. |
| `providers` | `Map<Uint<16>, JubjubPoint>` | Registered attestation provider public keys (Jubjub) |

### Nested Map Access Pattern

```compact
// Outer map: derived userPubKey → inner map
// Inner map: loanId → LoanApplication
export ledger loans: Map<Bytes<32>, Map<Uint<16>, LoanApplication>>;

// Initialize on first use
if (!loans.member(userPk)) {
    loans.insert(userPk, default<Map<Uint<16>, LoanApplication>>);
}
// Count
const loanCount = loans.lookup(userPk).size();
// Insert
loans.lookup(userPk).insert(loanId, loan);
```

## Circuits Reference

### `requestLoan(amountRequested: Uint<16>, secretPin: Uint<16>): []`

Entry point. Validates the caller, runs the private credit evaluation (which itself verifies an attestation signature), and records the outcome.

```compact
export circuit requestLoan(amountRequested: Uint<16>, secretPin: Uint<16>): [] {
    assert(amountRequested > 0, "Loan amount must be greater than zero");
    const requesterPubKey = deriveUserPublicKey(getUserSecret(), secretPin);
    const disclosed = disclose(requesterPubKey);

    assert(!blacklist.member(disclosed), "Requester is blacklisted");
    assert(!onGoingPinMigration.member(disclosed as Bytes<32>),
           "PIN migration is in progress for this user");

    // Bound the signed attestation to this specific user identity
    const userPubKeyHash = transientHash<Bytes<32>>(disclosed as Bytes<32>);

    const [topTierAmount, status] = evaluateApplicant(userPubKeyHash);
    createLoan(disclosed as Bytes<32>, amountRequested,
               disclose(topTierAmount), disclose(status));
}
```

The caller's identity comes from `deriveUserPublicKey(getUserSecret(), secretPin)` — the witness secret combined with the PIN, NOT from `ownPublicKey()`. The contract never consults the prover-claimed wallet pubkey.

### `respondToLoan(loanId: Uint<16>, secretPin: Uint<16>, accept: Boolean): []`

Resolves a `Proposed` loan. Only the loan owner (whose witness secret + PIN derive to the loan's storage key) can respond. Accepting flips status to `Approved` at the proposed amount; declining flips to `NotAccepted` with amount 0.

### `evaluateApplicant(userPubKeyHash: Field): [Uint<16>, LoanStatus]`

Private credit evaluation — runs off-chain as part of proof generation. Calls the `getAttestedScoringWitness` witness to pull the user's profile, signature, and provider id from local private state. Then:

1. Asserts the provider is registered on-chain
2. Looks up the provider's Jubjub public key
3. Builds the signed message as `Vector<4, Field>` = `[creditScore, monthlyIncome, monthsAsCustomer, userPubKeyHash]`
4. Runs `Schnorr_schnorrVerify<4>(msg, signature, providerPk)` — fails the whole transaction if the signature is invalid
5. Applies the tier logic below

```compact
circuit evaluateApplicant(userPubKeyHash: Field): [Uint<16>, LoanStatus] {
    const [profile, signature, providerId] = getAttestedScoringWitness();

    assert(providers.member(disclose(providerId)), "Attestation provider not registered");
    const providerPk = providers.lookup(disclose(providerId));

    const msg: Vector<4, Field> = [
        profile.creditScore as Field,
        profile.monthlyIncome as Field,
        profile.monthsAsCustomer as Field,
        userPubKeyHash
    ];
    Schnorr_schnorrVerify<4>(msg, signature, providerPk);

    // Tier 1: max $10,000
    if (profile.creditScore >= 700 && profile.monthlyIncome >= 2000 && profile.monthsAsCustomer >= 24) {
        return [10000, LoanStatus.Approved];
    }
    // Tier 2: max $7,000
    else if (profile.creditScore >= 600 && profile.monthlyIncome >= 1500) {
        return [7000, LoanStatus.Approved];
    }
    // Tier 3: max $3,000
    else if (profile.creditScore >= 580) {
        return [3000, LoanStatus.Approved];
    }
    else {
        return [0, LoanStatus.Rejected];
    }
}
```

### `createLoan(requester, amountRequested, topTierAmount, status): []`

Writes to the `loans` ledger. If `amountRequested > topTierAmount` the loan is stored with status `Proposed` (awaiting `respondToLoan`); otherwise the passed-through status is used.

### `changePin(oldPin: Uint<16>, newPin: Uint<16>): []`

Batched migration of a user's loans from `deriveUserPublicKey(getUserSecret(), oldPin)` to `deriveUserPublicKey(getUserSecret(), newPin)`. Fixed batch size of 5 per transaction. `onGoingPinMigration` records the last-migrated loanId so the DApp can call `changePin` repeatedly until all loans are moved.

Key constraint: Compact circuits cannot iterate over variable-length collections, hence the fixed-size loop + off-chain orchestration.

### `deriveUserPublicKey(sk: UserSecretKey, pin: Uint<16>): UserPublicKey`

Deterministic per-user identity: `persistentHash(["zkloan:user:pk:v1", hash(pin), sk])`. Derived from the witness secret + PIN — never from `ownPublicKey()`. The PIN never appears on-chain; only the derived key does. Exported so the CLI/UI can compute the same value off-chain (loan-map lookups, blacklist targeting).

### Admin Circuits

All guarded by `assert(contractAdmin == deriveAdminPublicKey(getUserSecret()), ...)`. The admin holds a 32-byte `userSecretKey` in private state; the ledger stores only the derived admin public key. The equality check enforces, inside the ZK circuit, that the caller knows the preimage of `contractAdmin`. Any chain reader can copy the ledger value, but only the holder of the secret can satisfy the constraint.

```compact
export circuit blacklistUser(account: UserPublicKey): []
export circuit removeBlacklistUser(account: UserPublicKey): []
export circuit registerProvider(providerId: Uint<16>, providerPk: JubjubPoint): []
export circuit removeProvider(providerId: Uint<16>): []
export circuit rotateAdmin(newAdmin: AdminPublicKey): []
```

The `rotateAdmin` flow hands the role to a new admin without transmitting any private key. The new admin generates their own secret locally, calls `deriveAdminPublicKey` off-chain to compute their public key, and sends only the resulting 32-byte value to the current admin. The current admin submits `rotateAdmin(newAdmin)` to overwrite `contractAdmin` on the ledger.

---

## Attestation Signature Flow

Credit data is signed off-chain by a registered provider and verified inside the ZK circuit. This prevents a malicious DApp from fabricating a high score client-side.

1. Admin calls `registerProvider(id, pk)` with a Jubjub public key.
2. A trusted service (see [zkloan-credit-scorer-attestation-api](../zkloan-credit-scorer-attestation-api)) signs `[creditScore, monthlyIncome, monthsAsCustomer, userPubKeyHash]` using Schnorr on Jubjub.
3. The user stores the signature + providerId in their local private state.
4. During `requestLoan`, the witness exposes the profile + signature + providerId. `evaluateApplicant` verifies the signature inside the circuit before applying the tier rules.

Note: `JubjubPoint` is opaque in language 0.22 — coordinates must be read via `jubjubPointX(p)` / `jubjubPointY(p)`, not `.x` / `.y`. Point equality also can't use `==` directly (the compiler generates `===` which is JS reference equality); compare coordinates instead. See [schnorr.compact](src/schnorr.compact).

---

## TypeScript Witness Implementation

File: [witnesses.ts](src/witnesses.ts)

```typescript
export type SchnorrSignature = {
  announcement: { x: bigint; y: bigint };
  response: bigint;
};

export type ZKLoanCreditScorerPrivateState = {
  creditScore: bigint;
  monthlyIncome: bigint;
  monthsAsCustomer: bigint;
  attestationSignature: SchnorrSignature;
  attestationProviderId: bigint;
  userSecretKey: Uint8Array;  // 32 bytes — the caller's authentic identity
};

export const witnesses = {
  getAttestedScoringWitness: ({ privateState }) => [
    privateState,
    [
      {
        creditScore: privateState.creditScore,
        monthlyIncome: privateState.monthlyIncome,
        monthsAsCustomer: privateState.monthsAsCustomer,
      },
      privateState.attestationSignature,
      privateState.attestationProviderId,
    ],
  ],

  // Witness-assisted division of the challenge hash by 2^248 so the
  // truncated challenge fits in the Jubjub scalar field.
  getSchnorrReduction: ({ privateState }, challengeHash) => {
    const q = challengeHash / TWO_248;
    const r = challengeHash % TWO_248;
    return [privateState, [q, r]];
  },

  // The single source of caller identity. The contract uses this to derive
  // both per-user pubkeys (`deriveUserPublicKey`) and the admin pubkey
  // (`deriveAdminPublicKey`). Validate the length so a malformed witness is
  // rejected at proof time, not on-chain.
  getUserSecret: ({ privateState }) => {
    if (!privateState.userSecretKey || privateState.userSecretKey.length !== 32) {
      throw new Error("userSecretKey is missing or wrong length");
    }
    return [privateState, privateState.userSecretKey];
  },
};
```

## Testing

### Simulator Pattern

`src/test/zkloan-credit-scorer.simulator.ts` wraps the compiled contract. It generates a provider keypair in its constructor, builds an initial signed private state via `createSignedUserProfile`, and registers the provider so that `requestLoan` calls have a valid attestation to verify.

### Example

```typescript
it("approves a Tier 1 loan, capping at the max amount", () => {
  const sim = new ZKLoanCreditScorerSimulator();
  const pin = 1234n;

  sim.requestLoan(15000n, pin);  // over the tier 1 ceiling → Proposed

  // The loan key is the caller's derived user pubkey (witness secret + PIN),
  // not a wallet address — same value the contract computes in-circuit.
  const loan = sim.getLedger().loans
    .lookup(sim.deriveUserPublicKey(sim.userSecretKey, pin))
    .lookup(1n);

  expect(loan.status).toEqual(LoanStatus.Proposed);
  expect(loan.authorizedAmount).toEqual(10000n);
});
```

## Commands

### Contract

```bash
cd contract

npm run compact       # compact compile — generates src/managed/
npm run build         # tsc + copy managed/ into dist/
npm test              # vitest
npm run test:compile  # compact compile && vitest
npm run lint
```

### CLI

```bash
cd zkloan-credit-scorer-cli

npm run standalone       # against a local docker-compose network
npm run testnet-remote   # against the remote testnet (needs WALLET_MNEMONIC + tDUST)
npm run test-api         # docker-backed integration tests
npm run build
```

## Privacy Model

### Private (never on-chain)

- `creditScore`, `monthlyIncome`, `monthsAsCustomer` — stored in `ZKLoanCreditScorerPrivateState`, encrypted on disk by the level-private-state-provider
- `secretPin` — never stored; only its hash contributes to the derived public key
- The full attestation signature and the provider's choice (until the signature is verified in-circuit)
- `userSecretKey` — single 32-byte secret per browser/CLI instance. Drives both the per-user identity (`deriveUserPublicKey(secret, pin)`) and the admin role (`deriveAdminPublicKey(secret)`). The deployer's derived admin pubkey is frozen into `contractAdmin`; everyone else's `getUserSecret()` produces a value whose hash does not match, so admin assertions fail for them. Domain separation keeps the per-user and admin pubkeys uncorrelated

### Public (on the ledger)

- Derived `userPubKey` (`Bytes<32>`) — unlinkable from the wallet's Zswap key without the PIN
- `LoanStatus` and `authorizedAmount`
- Blacklist entries
- Registered provider ids + Jubjub public keys
- `contractAdmin` (`AdminPublicKey`) — the admin's derived public key. The matching private secret is in the admin's local state

### Leak Prevention

1. All witness-derived data that reaches ledger operations goes through `disclose()` — otherwise the compiler rejects the write
2. Credit evaluation is entirely off-chain; only the tier outcome is disclosed
3. PIN is hashed into the public key; rotating the PIN yields a brand-new, unlinkable identity (hence the `changePin` migration logic)

## Common Compact Patterns in This Project

### Access control
```compact
// Witness-derived keypair pattern. The admin proves knowledge of the secret
// whose hash is stored in `contractAdmin`. `ownPublicKey()` is never called
// in this contract — it returns a value the prover claims and any assertion
// that depends on it is bypassable, even for blacklist or identity checks.
assert(contractAdmin == deriveAdminPublicKey(getUserSecret()), "Only admin can blacklist users");
```

### Nested map init
```compact
if (!loans.member(requester)) {
    loans.insert(requester, default<Map<Uint<16>, LoanApplication>>);
}
```

### Auto-incrementing IDs
```compact
const loanNumber = (loans.lookup(requester).size() + 1) as Uint<16>;
```

### Blocking during migration
```compact
assert(!onGoingPinMigration.member(userPk), "PIN migration in progress");
```

### Fixed-size batch
```compact
for (const i of 0..5) {  // compile-time constant
    if (condition) { ... }
}
```

### JubjubPoint (0.22)
```compact
// Access coords via circuits, not .x / .y
const x: Field = jubjubPointX(point);
const y: Field = jubjubPointY(point);

// Equality: compare coords, not the whole point — the compiler emits `===`
// which is JS reference equality on the opaque object
assert(jubjubPointX(lhs) == jubjubPointX(rhs) &&
       jubjubPointY(lhs) == jubjubPointY(rhs),
       "points not equal");
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. Batch size for `changePin` is hardcoded at 5 per transaction
2. No loan repayment / settlement tracking — the contract models only application + response
3. A single provider signs the attestation; no multi-provider threshold or rotation of signed payload format
4. The attestation API is a demo-grade signer; in production it would need HSM-backed key custody and access control
